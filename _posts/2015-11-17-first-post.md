## Code

You might like the following code:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Or maybe a more complicated one:

```python
from numpy.random import gumbel
def gumbel_max_sample(x):
    z = gumbel(loc=0, scale=1, size=x.shape)
    return (x + g).argmax(axis=1)
```
